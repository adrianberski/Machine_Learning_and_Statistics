    "<i>SciPy is built on the NumPy array framework and takes scientific programming to a whole new level by supplying advanced mathematical functions like integration, ordinary differential equation solvers, special functions, optimizations, and more. To list all the functions by name in SciPy would take several pages at minimum. When looking at the plethora of SciPy tools, it can sometimes be daunting even to decide which functions are best to use.</i>\n",
